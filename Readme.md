# Project Background
The dataset we chose for this project is 'Spending and Revenue' for the city of San Francisco. The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of spending and revenue data sourced from it's citywide financial system. This data can be accessed from https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Spending-and-Revenue/bpnb-jwfb.
We found this data interesting because it had great amount of transactions with multiple dimensions. Plus, new data is added on a weekly basis, and is available from fiscal year 2000 forward. Another advantage of this dataset was that it is clean and tidy. All columns are well-defined and null values are not common, which will aid us in our analysis. A look into the Spending and Revenue of government departments could help both the public and the government itself, get insights into how funds are being utilised and generated. This would lead to greater government accountability to the public and the insights required for self-appraisal for the government.
